# JavaScript-Flickr-Api
A simple JavaScript program, with a frontend, a backend API and incorporates Flickr's own API to create a small gallery of Star Wars pictures to view.

By going into ./routes/images/ you can add your own API key from Flickr (which is needed to receive the pictures from Flickr), and also exchange the Star Wars search term in the Flickr API call to search for something else you'd like to get a gallery of.

A potential update is definitely to make it so the user can, from the frontend, can give an input of what they'd like to search for, which would then be sent to the backend and Flickr, which would then be returned in the gallery.
